# BooleanNetworksOfGRN

The python code provided here can be used to generate and study Boolean networks. 
The BooleanNetwork class allows to generate random networks, read in predefined network files, manipulate the nodes of the network, calculate updates and find attractor states. Methods for further analysis, especially with reagrd to the information theoretic properies can be found in the boolean_network_functions module. 
Examples of the usage of the BooleanNetwork class and the analysis methods are detailed in the ExampleNotebook. 
Further description can be found in the pdf document.
